## üöÄ Project Overview  
- **Objective:** Predict the probability of credit events (default vs. non-default) using financial ratios and classification models.  
- **Workflow:**  
  1. Data balancing with **upsampling** to address class imbalance.  
  2. Feature engineering of key **financial ratios** (e.g., DER, CR, GPM, ROE, ROA, IR).  
  3. Model training and hyperparameter tuning with **Logistic Regression**.  
  4. Evaluation using **ROC AUC, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods  
- **Balancing:** Implemented an upsampling strategy to equalize minority and majority classes.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created financial ratios such as Debt-to-Equity Ratio (DER), Current Ratio (CR), Gross Profit Margin (GPM), Return on Equity (ROE), Return on Assets (ROA), and Indebtedness Ratio (IR).  
- **Model Selection:** Used **GridSearchCV** with cross-validation to optimize Logistic Regression hyperparameters.

## üìà Results  
- **Best Logistic Regression Model:** AUC ‚âà **0.76** (cross-validation).  
- **Classification Report (Test Set):**  
  - Precision: ~0.71 (class 0), 0.68 (class 1)  
  - Recall: ~0.64 (class 0), 0.74 (class 1)  
  - Accuracy: ~0.69 overall  

‚úÖ These results show the model effectively balances sensitivity (recall) and precision for credit event prediction.
